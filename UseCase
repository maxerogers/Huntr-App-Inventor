UseCase:
User Login
  User will fill out input fields [:email, :password]. An HTTP request will be made
  to the server, if it a valid answer then the use will recieve a token else they will
  be prompt that the inputs are invalid. In addition there will be an option to signup as a new user
User Sign_up:
  User fills out the input fields[ :email, :password, :password_confirm]
  Then a HTTP request with a callback is called to the server. It checks if the
  email is already taken. If it available then it checks to see if the passwords are the same
  Maybe check to see if the passwords are up to standard. IF not, then request the user to submit another one
  If the password is correct then a User record is created and a auth token is created.
  Then the user will be sent to their profile picture
